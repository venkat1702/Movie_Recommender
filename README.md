# Movie Recommender system using python
A recommender system is a simple algorithm which is used to provide the most relevant information of a user by discovering patterns in a dataset. The algorithm rates the items and shows the user the items that they would rate highly. An example of recommendation system is when you visit e-commerce websites like amazon/flipkart we notice that some items are being recommended to you or when Netflix recommends certain movies to you. They are also used by Music streaming applications such as Spotify to recommend music that you might like.
## Recommender systems types:
- 1.Content-based
- 2.Collabrative Filtering
 This is a collabrative filtering based model which is done using python  and pandas library.
